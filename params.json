You can use your user name and password for accessing these toolboxes.\r\n\r\n### Release Information\r\n\r\nCurrent release is 0.132.\r\n\r\nIncluded a function to return the default functions to be used for particular constraints and a function to return the default optimiser.\r\n\r\nAdded wrappers for using Carl Rasmussen's conjugate gradient code.\r\n\r\nThis toolbox allows computation of several different non-linearities and associated conversions and their gradients.\r\n\r\nThere are several kernels implemented, the ones that are being maintained for the latest release are:\r\n\r\n`exp sigmoid negLogLogit`\r\n\r\n`exp` constrains a parameter to be positive through exponentiatiation. `sigmoid` constrains a parameter to be between 0 and 1 through the sigmoid function and `negLogLogit` constrains a parameter to be positive through the function `log(1+exp(x))`. In much of the code based on this we prefer `negLogLogit` to `exp` as it is better behaved for large `x`.\r\n\r\nPage last modified on Fri Jan 5 22:19:06 GMT 2007.\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
